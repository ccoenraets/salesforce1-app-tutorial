module and go directly to [Module 3](create-custom-object.html).

If you don't have a supported device available, or to quickly test something during development, 
you can also simulate (emulate) the Salesforce1 app in your computer's browser:

1. Login into your Developer Edition account

1. Modify the URL:
    - Remove the part of the URL that comes immediately after **salesforce.com**
    - Append **/one/one.app** to the URL immediately after **salesforce.com**

title: Module 1&#58; Creating a Developer Edition Account
---
In this module, you create a Developer Edition Account that provides you with a full-featured but isolated Salesforce environment to perform the exercises in this tutorial.

> If you already signed up for a Developer Edition account, you can skip the instructions below and go directly to 
[Module 2](install-salesforce1-app.html).


## Steps

1. Open a browser and access the following URL: [http://developer.salesforce.com/signup](http://developer.salesforce.com/signup)

2. Fill in the signup form:
  - Enter your First Name and Last Name
  - For **Email**, enter an email address you have access to at this time (you will need to open an activation email)
  - For **Username**, specify a unique user name in the form of an email address. For example: **firsname.lastname@s1tutorial.com** (It doesn't have to be an existing email address: the Username is not used to send you emails)
  - Check the Master Subscription Agreement checkbox and click the **Sign Me Up** button

3. Check your email. You will receive an activation email for your Developer Edition Account.

4. Click the link in the activation email. Enter your new password information, and click **Save**.

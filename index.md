title: Salesforce1 App Developer Tutorial
---
In this tutorial, you create an expense report mobile application in Salesforce1. The application allows users to add
 expenses, assign them to expense reports, and submit expense reports for approval. In the first part of the 
 tutorial, you build the entire application declaratively (without writing code). In the second part of the 
 tutorial, you use code to add advanced features to the application. 

## What You Will Learn

## Prerequisites

- To complete this tutorial, all you need is a modern browser and a connection to the Internet
- No prior knowledge of Salesforce is required


## Device Requirements

> **You don't need a mobile device to complete this tutorial**: You can emulate the Salesforce1 app in your 
computer's browser. Instructions are provided in Module 2.

To install the Salesforce1 mobile app, you need one of the following devices:

- iPhone or iPad with iOS 7 or later
- Android device with Android 4.2 or later 

If your device is not supported to install the Salesforce1 mobile app, you can run Salesforce1 in
 the device's browser on a larger number of devices. Consult [this document](http://help

- You can also use the Comments section at the bottom of each module to ask a question or report a problem.


## Credits and Acknowledgments

An Expense Management application is a great use case for a tutorial: It's a well understood problem, not too
 big and not too small. I've used it for [workshops and tutorials](http://devgirl.org/files/MAX_LAB_2011/Building%20an%20Enterprise%20App%20for%20Android%20Tablets%20in%2090%20Minutes-MAX2011-FINAL.pdf) in different languages.  

I also want to acknowledge Andres Perez who wrote an [expense tracking sample application](http://www.eltoro.it/apex/ArticleViewer?id=a07A000000T3GOpIAN) for the Salesforce1 App way before me. Our implementations are very 
different which is a testament to the versatility of the Salesforce1 Platform: Andres' implementation is more 
code-centric, and 
leverages jQuery Mobile. I encourage you to check it out. This implementation is mostly declarative.

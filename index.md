title: Salesforce1 App Developer Tutorial
---
In this tutorial, you create an expense report mobile application in Salesforce1. The application allows users to enter
 expenses, assign them to expense reports, and submit expense reports for approval. You build the entire application declaratively (without writing code). 

## What You Will Learn

- Install the Salesforce1 Application
- Create Mobile Layouts
- Create Compact Layouts
- Use the Chatter feed 
- Upload Images
- Create Global Actions
- Create Object Actions
- Create Mobile Cards
- Work with Related Lists
- Use Visualforce Pages in Salesforce1


## Prerequisites

- To complete this tutorial, all you need is a modern browser and a connection to the Internet
- No prior knowledge of Salesforce is required


## Device Requirements

> **You don't need a mobile device to complete this tutorial:** You can emulate the Salesforce1 Mobile App in your 
computer's browser. Instructions are provided in [Module 2](install-salesforce1-app.html).

To install the Salesforce1 Mobile App, you need one of the following devices:

- iPhone or iPad with iOS 7 or later
- Android device with Android 4.2 or later 

If your device is not supported to install the Salesforce1 Mobile App, you can run Salesforce1 in
 the device's browser on a larger number of devices. Consult [this document](http://help
.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=sf1_requirements.htm) for more information.

into any problem or if you have a suggestion to improve this tutorial.

## Credits and Acknowledgments

An Expense Management application is a great use case for a tutorial: It's a well understood problem, not too
 big and not too small. I've used it for [workshops and tutorials](http://devgirl.org/files/MAX_LAB_2011/Building%20an%20Enterprise%20App%20for%20Android%20Tablets%20in%2090%20Minutes-MAX2011-FINAL.pdf) in different languages.  

I also want to acknowledge Andres Perez who wrote an [expense tracking sample application](http://www.eltoro.it/apex/ArticleViewer?id=a07A000000T3GOpIAN) for the Salesforce1 App way before me. Our implementations are very 
different which is a testament to the versatility of the Salesforce1 Platform: Andres' implementation is more 
code-centric, and 
leverages jQuery Mobile. This implementation is entirely declarative.

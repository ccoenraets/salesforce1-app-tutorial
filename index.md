title: Salesforce1 App Developer Tutorial
---
In this tutorial, you create an expense report mobile application in Salesforce1. The application allows users to enter
 expenses, assign them to expense reports, and submit expense reports for approval. In the first part of the 
 tutorial, you build the entire application declaratively (without writing code). In the second part, you use code to add advanced features to the application. 

## What You Will Learn

- Install the Salesforce1 Application
- Create Mobile Layouts
- Create Compact Layouts
- Create Global Actions
- Create Object Actions
- Create Mobile Cards
- Work with Related Lists
- Use Visualforce Pages in Salesforce1
- Capture pictures in a Salesforce1 App
- Capture the User Location in a Salesforce1 App


## Prerequisites

- To complete this tutorial, all you need is a modern browser and a connection to the Internet
- No prior knowledge of Salesforce is required


## Device Requirements

> **You don't need a mobile device to complete this tutorial:** You can emulate the Salesforce1 mobile app in your 
computer's browser. Instructions are provided in [Module 2](install-salesforce1-app.html).

To install the Salesforce1 mobile app, you need one of the following devices:

- iPhone or iPad with iOS 7 or later
- Android device with Android 4.2 or later 

If your device is not supported to install the Salesforce1 mobile app, you can run Salesforce1 in
 the device's browser on a larger number of devices. Consult [this document](http://help
.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=sf1_requirements.htm) for more information. 


## Browser Requirements

The following browsers are supported when working with the Developer Console (used for the programmatic modules only):

  - Most recent version of Google Chrome
  - Most recent version of Mozilla Firefox
  - Most recent version of Safari
  - Internet Explorer 9 or higher

into any problem or if you have a suggestion to improve this tutorial.
- You can also use the Comments section at the bottom of each module to ask a question or report a problem.


## Credits and Acknowledgments

An Expense Management application is a great use case for a tutorial: It's a well understood problem, not too
 big and not too small. I've used it for [workshops and tutorials](http://devgirl.org/files/MAX_LAB_2011/Building%20an%20Enterprise%20App%20for%20Android%20Tablets%20in%2090%20Minutes-MAX2011-FINAL.pdf) in different languages.  

I also want to acknowledge Andres Perez who wrote an [expense tracking sample application](http://www.eltoro.it/apex/ArticleViewer?id=a07A000000T3GOpIAN) for the Salesforce1 App way before me. Our implementations are very 
different which is a testament to the versatility of the Salesforce1 Platform: Andres' implementation is more 
code-centric, and 
leverages jQuery Mobile. I encourage you to check it out. This implementation is mostly declarative.
